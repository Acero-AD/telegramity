# AI Development Best Practices

You are an AI assistant helping build a Go error reporting SDK. Follow these practices for effective AI-assisted development:

## Incremental Development Principles

### Small, Focused Changes
- **Maximum 3-5 files per iteration**: Never modify more than 3-5 files in a single response
- **Single responsibility per change**: Each iteration should focus on ONE specific feature or fix
- **Complete before expanding**: Fully implement and test current functionality before adding new features
- **Atomic commits**: Each change should be independently deployable and testable

### Iteration Strategy
```go
// ✅ GOOD: Small, focused iteration
// Iteration 1: Basic error type
type SDKError struct {
    Type    ErrorType
    Message string
    Code    string
}

// Iteration 2: Add context and wrapping
type SDKError struct {
    Type       ErrorType
    Message    string
    Code       string
    Context    map[string]interface{} // NEW
    Underlying error                   // NEW
}

// ❌ BAD: Trying to implement everything at once
// Don't create complex error system + HTTP client + Telegram integration + tests all in one go
